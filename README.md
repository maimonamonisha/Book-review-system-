## *Project Report: Book Review System*

### *1. Introduction*
The *Book Review System* is a web-based platform that enables book lovers to share their reviews, ratings, and recommendations on books they've read. This system allows users to browse books, read reviews from other readers, and contribute their own opinions and ratings once they register an account. The primary goal of the project is to create a seamless online environment where passionate readers can influence others to explore new books through honest and detailed reviews.

### *2. System Overview*
The *Book Review System* uses *PHP, **CodeIgniter* as the framework, and *MySQL* as the database management system. The system allows:
- Searching and browsing books.
- Viewing other user reviews without the need for an account.
- Rating books after commenting.
- Users must create an account to leave reviews and ratings.

### *3. Features*
- *User Management*: Users can register and log in to the platform.
- *Book Reviews*: Users can comment on and rate books theyâ€™ve read.
- *Search Functionality*: Users can search books by title, author, or genre.
- *Ratings*: After commenting on a book, users can provide a rating.
- *Admin Panel*: Admins have full access to manage users, books, and reviews.

### *4. Technologies Used*
- *Frontend*: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- *Backend: PHP with the **CodeIgniter* framework
- *Database*: MySQL
- *Hosting*: Web hosting services for the deployment of the application

### *5. SDLC Phases Overview*
The project follows the *Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)* to ensure systematic development, testing, and deployment of the Book Review System. The SDLC phases implemented are:

1. *Planning*: Define objectives, stakeholders, and initial requirements.
2. *Requirements Analysis*: Document both functional and non-functional requirements.
3. *Design*: Architectural and database design for the system.
4. *Development*: Implement the system with coding and testing.
5. *Testing*: Conduct various levels of testing to ensure system functionality.
6. *Deployment*: Deploy the application for user access.
7. *Maintenance*: Post-launch support, bug fixing, and updates.
